#+OPTIONS: todo:t
* Functionality
** TODO Integer correctness
*** Use smallest integer sizes always
*** Overflow-check all integer multiplication
*** Overflow-check all integer addition

** TODO Send failure messages
The broker should inform a worker if it couldn't forward a message.
It should send a diagnostic message back to the worker.

** TODO Idle Channels and Workers
Track time of last valid message received from each worker and on each channel.
When a connection request occurs, if all connects are full, cull an idle connection.
When a call request occurs, if all channels are full, cull an idle channel.

** TODO Timeouts
Every message forwarded to a client that requires a response should have a timeout.
Call Request
Clear Request
Reset Request

** TODO Throttling
*** TODO Message rate
For each worker, keep track of messages sent in the last XX (10?) seconds.
Kick any worker that sends too many messages.
*** TODO Data rate
For each worker, keep track of data sent in the last XX seconds.
Kick any worker that sends data too fast.

** More useful diagnostic messages
In a diagnostic, give more context on failure.

** Worker->Broker messages
DIRECTORY_REQUEST message asks broker for list of workers
DIRECTORY response lists workers

** Control->Broker interface
Add a req/rep socket to all curses-based control program to query 
List of workers and their stats
List of channels
Reset channel / clear channel
Disconnect worker

** Memory limitation
Have broker monitor memory size in real-time.

** TODO Add OpenID registration

* Missing Documentation
All the documentation is missing. ;-)

================================================================

"network congestion" cause is momentary failure

"network out of order" cause is longer failure
