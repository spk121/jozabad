X.121 Addresses
---------------

The original X.25 spec used X.121 addresses, which is as good a scheme as any, for now.

According to http://support.microsoft.com/kb/123203

AAA-B-CCCCCCCC-DD

AAA is a 3 digit "country code"
- Digit 1 is 2..7
- Digit 2 to 4 is 0..9

B is a "network id"

CCCCCCCC is the "national number" identifying a worker

DD is a subaddress identifying an instance of a worker.

In practice, this means that the broker will have a code AAA-B and will reject any worker connections with a different AAA-B.

Also, if a worker calls CCCCCCCC and it is busy, there might someday be functionality to forward the call to a specific CCCCCCCC-DD.

For now, the last two DD should never be used.
